# Clustering Countries for HELP International

The objective of this notebook is to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors that aim to describe the overall development of a country. The dataset contains information that can be used to assess a countries development based on these metrics.

An exploratory data analysis is carried out, followed by clustering to identify groups of countries with similar characteristics.

This would allow a NGO to make effective decisions on where to allocate money to achieve the greatest impact.
